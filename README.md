I would like to express my gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with the opportunity to work on these projects and for their invaluable support and guidance throughout my internship journey. Here are the tasks I completed:


## Task 5: Food Recognition
- Created a model to recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content.
- Trained on a dataset of food images with corresponding calorie values.
- Used CNNs to identify food items and provide calorie estimates.
- Helped users track dietary intake and make informed food choices.
